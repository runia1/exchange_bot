Strategies for making trades

When should I sell?
1. when I am vested and the price goes $5 below what I am holding at (you lose some but not too much)
2. when I am vested and the stock was on an upward trend, then starts going down

When should I buy?
1. when I am NOT vested and the stock was on a downward trend, then starts going up
